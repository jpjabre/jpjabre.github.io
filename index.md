#Machine Learning
**1.** Supervised Learning - predicting y using f(x)
Supervised learning is going from point A to point B  
**2.** Unsupervised Learning - no y in the equation

###Virtuous circle of AI vs ~~Non-virtuous circle of AI hype~~

**Virtuous circle of AI**
Build product ==> because great product you get a lot of users ==>  with lots of users you get tons of data ==> data makes the product better (with modern ml)

*Concept has been around for a long time but has become more important in recent time because of recent advancements*
	

**Non-virtuous circle of AI hype**
Evil AI hype! ==>  drives funding, which goes to anti-evil AI ==>  drives more evil AI hype. 
Angers AN as some people dedicated to drive hype to get more funding; causing misallocation of resources. 

>Worrying about evil AI robots is like worrying about over-crowding on Mars.
